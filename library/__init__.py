"""Library

The purpose of this app is to try to replicate a user's `real-world` personal
library. A user has their own set of books on their shelves and have their own
bookmarks and their own set of translations for a specific book.

A user should be able to add a book to their library, read that book, but they
should also be able to archive the library item and track their progress for
the book.

decyphr should also keep track of when the user started reading the book and
how long they take to read it. This would be good to get an idea of how long a
user takes to read any given book, but it would also be used to send users
reminders that they need to get back to reading a specific book.
