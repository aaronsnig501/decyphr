This section of functionality is difficult to test as the
information comes from the Google Books API, however I should 
still be able to test:

    - A request can be made to the endpoint
    - An appropriate error message will be returned if the API
        requirements aren't met
    - An error is thrown if the request isn't authenticated
    - The Google Books will not be called if the data already exists
        within Decyphr
